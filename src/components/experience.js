                    I have developed highly customised <strong>WordPress platforms</strong> with in-hous PHP framework.
                    I am currently a part of a team working on advanced landing-page platform based on Angular & rxjs stack.
                    I am responsible for turning top-notch designs into pixel-perfect components
                    with optimizations for better UX. I use broad technical stack that involves <strong>SASS
                    with SMACCS methodology, PHP 7.*, JavasScript with jQuery, ES5 & ES6 standards
                    and TypeScript, AMP pages.</strong> I comply to high coding standards with static analysis
                    and linters. I take part in researching new technical solutions and knowledge-sharing
                    in-hous events. For 1,5 year I took the role of <strong>Scrum Master</strong>,
                    introducing best practices and helping increase productivity in my team.

                    I have developed multi-language <strong>WordPress websites</strong> with plugins
                    such as WooCommerce or Advanced Custom Fields. I customised their functionality,
                    admin panel and front end. I used <strong>svg.js, aos</strong> and <strong>particles.js</strong>
                    to enhance user experience. I have been actively involved in the creation process
                    and cooperated closely with the designer and clients.

                    My main responsibility was creating landing pages, templates and stylesheets,
                    and extending functionalities of existing projects.
                    I worked with various <strong>Content Management Systems</strong> (WordPress, Django, Dancer)
                    and <strong>JavaScript libraries</strong> (jQuery, Backbone.js, Underscore.js)
                    I used <strong>git for version</strong> control daily.
                    I was introduced to <strong>AMP</strong> and used it for internal projects.
                    During my work at Sidnet I have learnt how to approach complex projects
                    and go through various stages of web development.

                    I was a camp director and a supporting mentor during two summer camps for children.
                    I successfully conducted programming classes for children aged 7
                    - 15, teaching them languages (such as Scratch and JavaScript) and other
                    STEM activities. This experience gave me confidence in my programming knowledge.
                    Explaining coding to children helped me understand its concepts better.

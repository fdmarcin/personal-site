## Hi!

Welcome to my personal site project!

There is so much hype about Gatsby.js, I thought I will give a try. Although, I do not work with React.js, I like to try out new stuff.

How was it?

Quick, fun and light.  I totally recommend it if you need to quickly create a little project as this. 

I've decided to carry on and I'm going to add more content. Stay tuned! ðŸš€

## Tech stack

* gatsby.js
* sass
